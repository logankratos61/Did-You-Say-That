# Did-You-Say-That
*A fun machine learning application on your own whatsapp applications!*   
A simple script to let the machine check how many messeges were really yours (not really).   
It takes simple usage of NLTK libraries to train itself with the conversation.   

### What does this version offers?

Well, for introductory version **1.0** this application offers you to just train your data and let the machine show you how accurate it is
(I know..not so impressive, but the good things always have to wait ;) )    

### Highlights that are coming soon

Soon this script will offer you with options to input your own messeges and make you predict whether you said it or was it the *other guy*? I will be adding group chat features 
for identification soon. The graphical representation is right now only available in *Jupyter Notebook* version of this  program.   

### Future Works in my mind

1. Using the algorithm with some unicode filtering to use it on books and make it work like plagiarism checker for literary works.
2. Making a recommender system out of user's text responses (will include a little **tensorflow** here)

### Drawbacks of this script
1. It's just a script which you have to copy and paste to make it work (I'm not yet a python developer. Apologies for that)
2. The algo so far uses no unicode filter or any stemming, which may alter the prediction accuracy bigtime!

#### Do contibute if you feel it's worth your time
